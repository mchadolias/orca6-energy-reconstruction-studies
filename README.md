## KM3NET ORCA6 Energy Reconstruction Studies

The study is conducted under the supervision of the KM3NeT branch of the NCSR Democritus and particulartly from the PhD candidate D. Stavropoulos and researcher Dr. Katernina Tzamarioudaki. Furthermore, it is funded as part of the Internship program of the Department of Physics of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki at the undergraduate level.

The work is intented to try to explain the energy reconstruction problem in the ORCA site for energies above 100 GeV. The code is mainly written in C and C++ since the ROOT software is extensively used for the analysis. Additional code has been developed for the events display and the preprocess of the ROOT files, however since it is based on previously developed code it can't be uploaded without prior permission.
