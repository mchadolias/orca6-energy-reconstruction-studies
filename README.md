The study is conducted under the supervision of the KM3NeT branch of the NCSR Democritus and particulartly from the PhD candidate D. Stavropoulos and researcher Dr. Katernina Tzamarioudaki. Furthermore, it is funded as part of the Internship program of the Department of Physics of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki at the undergraduate level.

The work is intented to try to explain the energy reconstruction problem in the ORCA site for energies above 100 GeV. The code is mainly written in C and C++ since the ROOT software is extensively used for the analysis.
